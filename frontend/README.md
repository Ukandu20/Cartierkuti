# Getting Started with Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build and serve the React frontend.

## Available Scripts

Inside the `frontend` directory you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the application in development mode and watches for changes.

### `npm run build`

Bundles the app for production into the `build` folder.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally so you can preview it.
